## Project Description

The aim of this project is to develop a system for analysing academic papers. The system will support analyses of authorship, sentiment, subject and topic. Users will be able to import articles into the data store in order to perform a variety of analytical queries including paper topic clustering, inter-author linking, inter-topic linking, relationships between authors and topics, sentiment analysis, paper outcomes, citation networks and timelines.

### Client
The client for this project is the course organisation team for practical software development in the EPCC MSc programme.

## Quick Start
Our project has been deployed in the EIDF VM and the implementation can be found in the CICD implementation documentation. Users who have access to the EIDF `eidf018-psd-assessment10a` VM can directly use the browser in the VM to access http://localhost:90. If you want to run this application on your local computer, you can refer the [setup](/Documents/Implementation/Setup.md) document.
