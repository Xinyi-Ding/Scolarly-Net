描述做成什么样的效果

### 2. <a id="topic-connection">Topic Connection</a>
- **2a. Linking Articles with the Same Topic:**
    - The system should link articles that share the same topic. 
    - Example: When a user chooses the "high performance computing (HPC)" topic, the system should present articles  discussing HPC.

- **2b. Establishing Connections Between Various Topics:**
    - The system should establish connections between various topics within the same domain. 
    - Example: When a user explores the topic "Computer Science," the system should showcase articles covering diverse but related subjects like machine learning and high-performance computing.
### 3. <a id="author-relationship">Author Relationship</a>
- **3a. Associating Authors Collaborating on the Same Paper: (Co-author)**
    - The system should establish connections between authors who are credited for the same paper. The relationship should be presented as "Co-author."
    - Example: If authors A and B are credited for the paper titled "Advancements in Artificial Intelligence," the system should display a "Co-author" relationship between A and B.
- **3b. Linking Authors Working in the Same Company or Department: (Colleague)** 
    - The system should connect authors who work in the same company or department. The relationship should be presented as "Colleague."
    - Example: If authors X and Y both work at XYZ Corporation, the system should show a "Colleague" relationship between X and Y.
- **3c. Connecting Authors with Family Relationships: (Co-Recipients of Awards)** 
    - If two authors have jointly received a specific award, the system should showcase their relationship as "Co-Recipients of Awards."

    - Example: If authors P and Q are relatives, the system should depict a "Family" relationship between P and Q.

### 4. Reference Tree
Most academic papers cite other research works, usually listed in the References section at the end of the document. This feature aims to enable users to construct a citation tree based on the References section of a current paper. It visually represents the citations of the current paper and its subsequent references, offering a clearer understanding of the paper's citation network.
Optionally, we could also develop a 'Cited-by Tree' to identify all papers that have cited the current paper, along with their previous level of references. This helps users comprehend the impact of the paper on subsequent research.

### 5. [User Defined Filter and Search](#user-defined-filter-and-search)
One crucial aspect of the proposed system is the implementation of a robust user-defined filter and search functionality. This feature empowers users across different domains, including students, academics, government officials, developers, and companies, to tailor their research queries based on specific criteria. The system will provide a highly customizable search interface allowing users to filter academic papers and other sources with precision.
