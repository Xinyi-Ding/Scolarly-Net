            - **Solution**:
                1. **Similarity Matching**: We used the similarity between titles as the criterion for determining whether two references are similar. If the similarity between the titles of two references exceeds a set threshold (`match_threshold=0.8`), we consider these two references as matched. This method effectively reduces match failures due to format differences or minor input errors.

                2. **Handling Empty Reference Lists**: At the beginning of the function, we check whether both input reference lists are empty. If so, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating a successful match. This addresses the previous issue where the case of empty reference lists was not handled, ensuring the robustness of the function.

                3. **Match Count and Ratio**: Within the function, a `match_count` variable is maintained to record the number of successfully matched references. By calculating the ratio of successfully matched references to the total number of manually extracted references (`match_ratio`), and comparing it with a set ratio threshold (`match_ratio_threshold=0.7`), the function decides whether the automatically extracted reference list is acceptable. This mechanism ensures that even if there are some mismatches, as long as the match ratio is sufficiently high, the overall extraction result is still considered reliable.

        - **Result Analysis**: The initial test results indicated a need for enhancements in the function's ability to handle format variations and missing references. The introduction of similarity matching and improved handling of empty reference lists were identified as potential solutions to improve the accuracy of the reference parsing functionality.

        - **Analysis**: The user experienced is partly satisfied in this case.
        - **Future Improvement**: Add info icons and a reset button as suggested.
   - **Overall Analysis**: The task of uploading a paper and generating a graph from the uploaded paper is clear and straightforward, and the information extracted from the paper is accurate. However, the information extraction process is a bit slow, and there are some small difficulties in system guidance. The system is good, but there are some improvements that can be made to enhance the user experience.
2. **Task 2: Search for A Paper**
   - **Description**: Search for a paper by title keyword in one of these sections: same topic, co-author and cited tree, then select a paper from the search results
   - **Goals**: 
     1. See the pop-up window that displays the search result list.
     2. All the papers are relevant to the search keyword.
     3. Select a paper from the list.
   - **Test Cases**:
     - **UTC ID: 2.1**
       - **Goals Achieved**: 3 passes, 0 fails
       - **Feedback**: The search process is clear and straightforward, and the search results are relevant to the search keyword. The speed of the search process is still a bit slow.
       - **Suggestions**: Improve the search speed.
       - **Analysis**: The user experienced is satisfied in this case. The feedback of long waiting time for search still might cause by the database.
       - **Improvement**: Deploy the database in the VM.
     - **UTC ID: 2.2**
       - **Goals Achieved**: 3 passes, 0 fails
       - **Feedback**: The search process is clear and straightforward, and the search results are relevant to the search keyword, but it is a bit confusing that why searching for paper title in co-author page instead of searching for author name. The network speed is a bit slow.
       - **Suggestions**: Add more search options.
       - **Analysis**: The user experienced is mostly satisfied in this case. Only search for paper title in every page is how the system is designed, but it is a bit confusing for the user without a clear explanation. 
       - **Future Improvement**: Add a clear explanation to the user, and add more search options is also a good idea because we already can do have search APIs for other options like author name or topic name, but still need to be integrated into the system.
     - **UTC ID: 2.3**
       - **Goals Achieved**: 3 passes, 0 fails
       - **Feedback**: The search process is clear and straightforward, and the search results are relevant to the search keyword. But the authors in the search results list are not fully displayed, which is a bit inconvenient.
       - **Suggestions**: The system is good, but provide a way to view the full author chip list of the paper in the search results list.
       - **Analysis**: The user experienced is mostly satisfied in this case. The display of the author chip list is limited by the space of the pop-up window, so it hides the parts that overflow.
       - **Future Improvement**: Hover on the author chip list to view the full list as suggested.
     - **UTC ID: 2.4**
       - **Goals Achieved**: 3 passes, 0 fails
       - **Feedback**: The search process is clear and straightforward, and the search results are relevant to the search keyword. But there is no search bar in the Dashboard page, which is a bit inconvenient.
       - **Suggestions**: Since every page has a search bar and can search for paper title only, it might be clearer to the user if the search bar is put in the app bar on the top of the page. In the paper list, there is a label could be added on top of each paper showing it is 'similar paper' like the 'original paper' label.
       - **Analysis**: The user experienced is partly satisfied in this case. The search bar problem is caused by the redundant search bar in each page all of which can only search for paper title, so it is a bit confusing.
       - **Future Improvement**: Add search bar in the app bar on the top of the page, change search bar in each page to an expandable icon that can be optional to show.
   - **Overall Analysis**: The search process is clear and straightforward, and the search results are relevant to the search keyword. More adjustments can be made to enhance the user experience, which should be pay attention to in the future design and development.
3. **Task 3: Generate Graphs**
   - **Description**: Generate different graphs in three available sections: Same-Topic, Co-Author, and Cited Tree using the techniques shown in the previous tasks.

     1. **UTC ID: 3.1**
        - **Goals Achieved**: 3 passes, 0 fails
        - **Feedback**: The process of generating a graph is clear and straightforward, but the title of the paper node in the graph makes the graph a bit messy. It takes too long to generate the graph.
        - **Suggestions**: Improve the graph generation speed and the display of the paper node title in the graph.
        - **Analysis**: The user experienced is partly satisfied in this case. The feedback of long waiting time for graph generation might cause by the database or the graph generation algorithm in the backend.
        - **Improvement**: Deploy the database in the VM, and optimize the graph generation algorithm in the backend.
     2. **UTC ID: 3.2**
        - **Goals Achieved**: 3 passes, 0 fails
        - **Feedback**: The process of generating a graph is clear and straightforward, and the graph is relevant to the section title.

     4. **UTC ID: 3.4**
        - **Goals Achieved**: 3 passes, 0 fails
        - **Feedback**: The process of generating a graph is clear and straightforward, and the graph is relevant to the section title. But the graph layout can be improved, and there is another problem that the graph will disappear when the user refreshes the page.
        - **Suggestions**: The system is good, but the graph layout needs to be optimized, and it is better that the graph can be saved when the user refreshes the page.
        - **Analysis**: The user experienced is partly satisfied in this case. The graph interaction problem is caused by the graph drawing tool Vis-network, which is not easy to control the interaction of the graph.
        - **Future Improvement**: Try to use route query to save the graph generation config, that can be used to generate the graph again when the user refreshes the page. The graph layout problem is the same as the previous case.
    - **Overall Analysis**: The process of generating a graph is clear and straightforward, and the graph is relevant to the section title. The system is good, but there are some improvements that can be made to enhance the user experience.
