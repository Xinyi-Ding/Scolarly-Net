# Usability Analysis Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the usability testing conducted for our web application. It will include details of the testing methodology used, findings and analysis of the test results, and recommendations for improving the user experience.

### Scope

This document will focus on the usability testing of the web application, specifically addressing the user interface and user experience. It will not cover functional testing or technical performance evaluation. 

### Methodology

The usability testing was conducted using a combination of direct observation, user feedback, and task success rates. Participants were asked to perform specific tasks within the application, with the guideline provided in the [Guide on how to use the application](Guide.md) and feedback form followed after. Their interactions and feedback were recorded and analyzed to identify usability issues and areas for improvement.

## 2. Usability Testing Methodology

### Participant Selection

The participants for the usability testing were selected based on the target user demographic for the web application. The initial candidate pool was introduced in the [Design Document](Design.md), which includes students, academics, government officials, developers, and companies. But due to the limited time and resources, the participants were selected from the students and academics.

### Testing Environment

The usability testing was conducted in a controlled environment, with access to the web application hosted on our group's EIDF. Participants who does not have access to the EIDF were provided with our
