# Documents Directory Overview

Welcome to the `Documents` directory of the PSD project. This directory serves as the central repository for all project-related documentation, ensuring team members have access to the latest plans, designs, and other critical information.

## Contents

- **Design.md**: This is the current design document for the project. It outlines the design principles, patterns, and specifications that our project adheres to. All team members working on design aspects should refer to this document for guidance.

- **Plan.md**: The project plan document contains timelines, milestones, tasks, and resource allocations. It's essential for project management and tracking the project's progress.

- **Image/**: This folder contains images and graphics related to the project, including diagrams, UI mockups, and other visual aids that support the documentation.

- **Design(deprecated).md**: Please note that this is an outdated design document and has been superseded by `Design.md`. It's kept for historical reference only and should not be used for current project activities.

## Usage Guidelines

- Always refer to the most current version of a document.
- For design-related queries or updates, consult `Design.md`.
- Project planning and status updates should align with the details in `Plan.md`.
- Visual aids and related graphics will be found within the `Image/` directory.
- Deprecated documents, such as `Design(deprecated).md`, are for archival purposes only. Do not use these for current project decisions.
